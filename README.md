📊 Bank Loan Report Project

📝 Project Overview

The Bank Loan Report project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of a bank’s lending activities. Using dynamic dashboards, this project helps visualize key loan metrics, track performance trends, and assess the health of the loan portfolio. By leveraging data-driven insights, banks can optimize lending strategies and monitor portfolio quality effectively.

This project includes three dynamic dashboards created with Tableau and a backend supported by MS SQL Server.
